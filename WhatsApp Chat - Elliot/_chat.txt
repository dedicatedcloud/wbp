I never ignored any of you I just didn’t want to see a message or call from my sister so I ignored my phone as much as I could that’s all. Since then there’s been an atmosphere Gio doesn’t speak and not do Leanne or Curtis and I don’t know what I’ve done other than grieve my mum In my way and I felt guilty at times doing that, scared too as well because if I didn’t know as much as I do I’d think you’d have fell out long before now, I get the feeling that’s what you want for some reason and that wasn’t meant for me that message earlier and I’ve been there through that least 8 friends ships you’ve just disposed of for god know what reasons I know how it goes.

[16/05/2022, 16:23:44] .: Kinda defeats the point really. You’d have to tally it all up to get a figure with the app as it’s not connected to the tills.
[16/05/2022, 16:28:26] .: What pos do you use Sqaure ?

I suppose it could be used for like the spirit cellar every time they take a bottle out they have to scan it help you keep track of high value Stuff
[16/05/2022, 16:30:49] Elliot: Yeah… the reason we are doing it like this, as with everything in this place the tills are fucked as they haven’t been set up and used properly from the start so instead of having all the stock figures correctly in the till system they are running at 10000000s 🙄 
That, plus we are looking at changing the till system
[16/05/2022, 16:34:51] .: Silly fucks

[18/05/2022, 00:01:50] Elliot: Knows how to fix everything
[18/05/2022, 12:04:04] Elliot: Hi ya
[18/05/2022, 12:04:06] Elliot: So
[18/05/2022, 12:04:26] Elliot: Tell me…. 
Why is this costing him this much ??
‎[18/05/2022, 12:04:29] Elliot: ‎image omitted
[18/05/2022, 12:07:08] .: It must be attached to a hosting package with that company. Is that what the main website is on .co.uk ?
[18/05/2022, 12:07:55] Elliot: Yes
[18/05/2022, 12:08:12] Elliot: So we shouldn’t be paying £28 a month then ?
[18/05/2022, 12:12:08] .: No well that depends to have a domain like . Co .uK.  Doesn’t cost anything apart from a yearly fee which is like £6 ish but you need to find out if that fee included the web hosting which is with Google I think it must be. You need to plan before you move it as well. It’s free to transfer a uk domain but you need to make sure the DNS is set up to avoid down time.
[18/05/2022, 12:12:57] Elliot: Errr ok 🤷🏼‍♂️
[18/05/2022, 12:13:13] .: Let me look a few things up
[18/05/2022, 12:14:04] Elliot: Just want to know why he saying it’s £28 a month
[18/05/2022, 12:15:51] .: I’m sure that comes with the hosting for the website aswel it must do. It doesn’t cost that to have a domain in an account I’ve got about 30 domain law it doesn’t  cost me anything apart from the yearly fee.  Let me look it up and il tell you what you need to do
[18/05/2022, 12:16:02] .: Who runs the website?
[18/05/2022, 12:21:59] Elliot: We do now
[18/05/2022, 12:22:33] .: Ok so what web host do you use?
[18/05/2022, 12:22:55] Elliot: Haven’t a clue
[18/05/2022, 12:23:32] .: Well I know but it weebly it’s like any company can sell lol
[18/05/2022, 12:26:51] Elliot: 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ I haven’t a clue what you just said
[18/05/2022, 12:30:42] .: Hah it’s hard to explain the website is built with a shitty website builder called weebly and loads of hosting company’s sell it as an add on when people buy a domain or hosting package. Message him and ask him if it 28 includes the web hosting for the website as well. ?
[18/05/2022, 12:39:25] .: Jesus I’ve just transferred one of my domains to them to see how there system works fucking hell! Don’t transfer anything yet because it will all go down including the gmail
[18/05/2022, 12:40:27] Elliot: Think Andrew and Ricardo know what to do, Andrew just tried to explain it to me ha ha
[18/05/2022, 12:42:21] .: Lol make sure you have secondary dns to be on the safe side of you move it
[18/05/2022, 12:44:05] Elliot: I’m not fucking touching it lol
[18/05/2022, 12:45:09] .: Thing is tho you may if it’s transferred to you and the dns records don’t
[18/05/2022, 12:45:14] Elliot: I’m having nightmares with the fucking printer so I’m not touching anything internet ha ha ha
[20/05/2022, 15:43:20] .: You still got a website up lol?
[20/05/2022, 15:43:50] Elliot: Dunno lol
[20/05/2022, 15:44:15] .: Yeah still there lol
[20/05/2022, 15:46:14] .: So what the fuck NOW

[13/06/2022, 08:54:24] Elliot: BAM
[13/06/2022, 08:56:01] .: I don’t understand how these people have these nightclubs why the fuck would you do that when you can do it your self with a small cost lol
[13/06/2022, 08:56:06] .: Fucking stupid
[13/06/2022, 08:58:13] .: If I was to ever need a ticket to go to the egg or anywhere the  first place I would go would be their website not dice or whereever it is
[13/06/2022, 09:02:32] .: Sounds like bullshit a bit as well though , who told you that
[13/06/2022, 09:07:21] Elliot: Curtis, he has an inside man
[13/06/2022, 09:07:27] Elliot: Tell him everything
[13/06/2022, 09:08:13] .: Mmmm they minght be telling him shit as well know he’s friend with you
[13/06/2022, 09:09:16] Elliot: The inside joke is if they don’t like they will go to Electrokerkz lol
[13/06/2022, 09:09:53] Elliot: Not with me, with Curtis, they are after him to, to put House of Trash on at Egg
[13/06/2022, 09:10:32] .: So they desperate for gigs and a company has paid them 100k ? Lol
[13/06/2022, 09:11:10] Elliot: They are always desperate… £100k to lock them in for a 2 year deal
[13/06/2022, 09:11:26] Elliot: Curtis got £17k to lock HoT in with Dice
[13/06/2022, 09:12:01] .: Would you go pay a Dj 100k for the next 2 years ?? Not knowing what would happen
[13/06/2022, 09:12:09] .: 17 k how long for
[13/06/2022, 09:12:39] Elliot: 2 years
[13/06/2022, 09:12:53] Elliot: But they have targets to beat etc
[13/06/2022, 09:13:15] .: And Curtis is going monthly with HOT then?
[13/06/2022, 09:13:26] Elliot: Guess this is why they wanted Hans house
[13/06/2022, 09:13:50] Elliot: Trying to get him to do more got a contract meeting with him on Wednesday
[13/06/2022, 09:13:53] .: With that or dice must banging so heavy ticket fees on
[13/06/2022, 09:14:12] Elliot: 10% I think
[13/06/2022, 09:16:48] .: Hmmmm this dice willl be going out of business doing things like that lol
[13/06/2022, 09:18:00] Elliot: They are useless cunts… our contract runs out in October, can’t wait to drop em
[13/06/2022, 09:18:14] Elliot: The account manager is useless cunt
[13/06/2022, 09:23:00] .: Parties like HOT don’t need to use sites like dice. They are literally throwing extra revenue away. Of top of my head Curtis could be making an extra £1100 per event minimum by not using them
[13/06/2022, 09:25:04] .: How much were the house of trash tickets?
[13/06/2022, 09:31:42] Elliot: I’ll look hold on
[13/06/2022, 09:32:57] Elliot: They at £27.03 now
[13/06/2022, 09:35:13] Elliot: Oh it’s a waiting list
[13/06/2022, 09:35:30] .: Exactly that’s my point
‎[13/06/2022, 09:35:42] Elliot: ‎image omitted
[13/06/2022, 09:36:06] .: Curtis via instagram and word of mouth has sent people to that website to give them money when he could do it him self lol
[13/06/2022, 09:36:21] Elliot: Yeah I guess
[13/06/2022, 09:37:41] .: I’m not going to ask but depending on what Curtis has asked for per ticket they are literally making the remainder profits
[13/06/2022, 09:39:34] Elliot: Yeah I guess, I don’t fully understand the ticket side of things… would be better just to pay on the door like XXL did dirty cash he he
[13/06/2022, 09:40:34] .: I had to make a event management app as part of a tutorial I did with the cloud course I seen then the money they make for literally sending a email. Haha
[13/06/2022, 09:48:40] .: Well not much to understand othet than if the tickets are going for £27 and say Curtis is getting £20 Curtis is giving nearly £7700 away per event, obviously  it’s not that much that £27 is because it’s waiting list, but even if the tickets at normal price dice add money on what could be going in Curtis or better still YOUR pockets
[13/06/2022, 09:49:55] Elliot: Mmmmm ok I understand now
[13/06/2022, 14:53:20] .: How’s being dead
[13/06/2022, 14:53:45] Elliot: Terrible

[03/07/2022, 06:25:35] Elliot: Well, me and little legs are still talking to you… and I’m sure if you messaged them they will say hi back
[03/07/2022, 06:35:28] .: Yeah not everyone has stopped talking I’ve got people who aren’t on the scene or live in London who I talk to, none from that side have changed so seeem to be only effecting London but then again  I’m not going to beg for or keep putting effort into fake friendships.

[20/07/2022, 19:36:14] .: He started with the fake friend status and don’t say it wasn’t because he removed the status after I put one

‎[20/07/2022, 19:47:11] Elliot: ‎image omitted
[20/07/2022, 19:48:26] Elliot: Why would he dislike you ? Helping you when you needed it etc… he’s always loved you especially when you stop him from getting mugged in Vauxhall. 
You really are reading the wrong book babes
[20/07/2022, 19:52:21] .: I’ve had BPD since a being a teenager I don’t have friends if I don’t feel comfortable around. I was before and for some reason I don’t feel it around any of you now. So no I’m not reading the wrong book. I get the sense you seem to think I developed BPD during the pandemic? Wrong, that condition is no different now than it was before I just had a major depression on top of me to deal with and I’ve come out of it and there is a atmosphere. Not helped but other factors like dropping me 4 days after my mum died for a day trip to Fucking Oxford i thought wow what a good one that was then got worse invite me to Jessica James 1905th career launch as a consultation prize haha
[20/07/2022, 19:52:40] .: Don’t fucking tell me I’m reading it wrong!
[20/07/2022, 19:53:54] .: Then not telling me about covid

[20/07/2022, 19:56:05] Elliot: Omg ! 🙄 I give up
[20/07/2022, 19:57:30] .: I came out for that my bday all be it I came home I came out nye l…… I’ve told you countless times I’m worried about thinking I’ve done something to people for them to just cut me off you then don’t invite me out for pride and then let slip you’ve been telling people I stay in
[20/07/2022, 19:59:21] .: It’s like your wanting to fall out , you can’t do it the usuall way so we’ll do it this way ……make him think we still friends then do shit like you’ve done tell people he’s just stopped coming out and think il walk away quietly
[20/07/2022, 19:59:25] Elliot: I invite you everywhere, you decline, I keep inviting you, you keep declining… I ask you to come to the club, you decline… do you go out with other friends then ? Or stay home ?
[20/07/2022, 20:00:04] Elliot: I’m not the one trying to fall out with our friendship
[20/07/2022, 20:02:00] .: You invite me to places I don’t feel comfortable like Curtis party I’ve did I feel like somethings has gone on there. Never had a invite and had stopped talking why would I go there? Roast I design a website for it encouraged by you to be then just told not really my decisions.  You would have know that when I said I was doing it
[20/07/2022, 20:03:09] Elliot: No I said do it then come in and show us like I’ve told you with everything
[20/07/2022, 20:03:25] .: Neither am I have like I said I came out your bday my bday nye the first trough
[20/07/2022, 20:03:52] .: Then see sarcasm about keeping you company from Andrew
[20/07/2022, 20:04:30] .: I asked to go Vauxhall you went with out me
[20/07/2022, 20:05:55] .: I’ve literally been biting my tounge for months on it I’ve showed other people thinking its on my head but there too many things happened for me not to think this way
[20/07/2022, 20:06:14] Elliot: Well, if you came out we could go out.. and before going out sit down and talk…
[20/07/2022, 20:07:07] .: You know full well how many times I’ve said if it’s me being upset what’s caused this atmosphere and people to cut me off
[20/07/2022, 20:07:23] Elliot: All we been doing is working day and night at the club, happy for you to come on board and join us but you keep saying no
[20/07/2022, 20:08:14] Elliot: We gave you space to Greave, dunno, did you want us to come and mollycoddle you all the time ?
[20/07/2022, 20:08:17] .: And when would be a goo opportunity to go out oooo like pride and the day I came up and said let’s go out and one other Occasion after that
[20/07/2022, 20:08:32] .: When you went with out me

[20/07/2022, 20:09:54] Elliot: Soho is Vile when sober
[20/07/2022, 20:10:02] Elliot: And 3 hours sleep
[20/07/2022, 20:10:10] .: I tried to cancel that thinking that was causing this atmosphere and people to just go cold on me. I tried to block her out made it ten times Fucking worse
[20/07/2022, 20:10:11] Elliot: With a 8 hour shift to come
[20/07/2022, 20:10:24] .: Hmmm I bet
