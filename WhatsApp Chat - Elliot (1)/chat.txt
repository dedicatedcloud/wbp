[18/03/2022, 19:50:09] .: Yes it was space I needed during the pandemic, so I could deal with the fact I knew my mum would die and issues I had to deal with, what’s caused this atmosphere there seems to be. I never ignored any of you I just didn’t want to see a message or call from my sister so I ignored my phone as much as I could that’s all. Since then there’s been an atmosphere Gio doesn’t speak and not do Leanne or Curtis and I don’t know what I’ve done other than grieve my mum In my way and I felt guilty at times doing that, scared too as well because if I didn’t know as much as I do I’d think you’d have fell out long before now, I get the feeling that’s what you want for some reason and that wasn’t meant for me that message earlier and I’ve been there through that least 8 friends ships you’ve just disposed of for god know what reasons I know how it goes.
[18/03/2022, 20:02:44] Elliot: Ooooook…. Listen, we are always here for you, “friends” come and go those that go aren’t real friends, Gio I think is off on his own path, I haven’t spoke with him for an age either…. Curtis and Leanne are off with all the gay lot now, we to have been left on the side,  but you, you are always there and hopefully always will be.. there’s no atmosphere between us, why would there be, we have all gone through tough times in the last 2 years, you more so. 
Don’t think we have issues, we haven’t… god sake I need someone to judge people with… especially if we’re going Beefmince on the 1st lol
[18/03/2022, 20:06:01] Elliot: I guess I’ve been a bit shoddy with everything lately, just had a lot on with this take over thing… but that’s all… you are part of our plans, friends and part of the future of the club 🤗

[16/05/2022, 14:40:32] Elliot: I like the free bit
[16/05/2022, 14:42:06] .: Do you get sales figures of what you have sold each night per product
[16/05/2022, 14:42:24] Elliot: Yes babes
[16/05/2022, 14:42:59] .: So you know what stick you have you just count it to make sure it’s all there?
[16/05/2022, 14:43:06] .: Stock
[16/05/2022, 14:50:28] Elliot: Count it then I check it against the figures to see if anyone has nicked it
[16/05/2022, 16:23:44] .: Kinda defeats the point really. You’d have to tally it all up to get a figure with the app as it’s not connected to the tills.
[16/05/2022, 16:28:26] .: What pos do you use Sqaure ?

I suppose it could be used for like the spirit cellar every time they take a bottle out they have to scan it help you keep track of high value Stuff
[16/05/2022, 16:30:49] Elliot: Yeah… the reason we are doing it like this, as with everything in this place the tills are fucked as they haven’t been set up and used properly from the start so instead of having all the stock figures correctly in the till system they are running at 10000000s 🙄 
That, plus we are looking at changing the till system
[16/05/2022, 16:34:51] .: Silly fucks

[18/05/2022, 12:04:04] Elliot: Hi ya
[18/05/2022, 12:04:06] Elliot: So
[18/05/2022, 12:04:26] Elliot: Tell me…. 
Why is this costing him this much ??
‎[18/05/2022, 12:04:29] Elliot: ‎<attached: 00004362-PHOTO-2022-05-18-12-04-29.jpg>
[18/05/2022, 12:07:08] .: It must be attached to a hosting package with that company. Is that what the main website is on .co.uk ?
[18/05/2022, 12:07:55] Elliot: Yes
[18/05/2022, 12:08:12] Elliot: So we shouldn’t be paying £28 a month then ?
[18/05/2022, 12:12:08] .: No well that depends to have a domain like . Co .uK.  Doesn’t cost anything apart from a yearly fee which is like £6 ish but you need to find out if that fee included the web hosting which is with Google I think it must be. You need to plan before you move it as well. It’s free to transfer a uk domain but you need to make sure the DNS is set up to avoid down time.
[18/05/2022, 12:12:57] Elliot: Errr ok 🤷🏼‍♂️
[18/05/2022, 12:13:13] .: Let me look a few things up
[18/05/2022, 12:14:04] Elliot: Just want to know why he saying it’s £28 a month
[18/05/2022, 12:15:51] .: I’m sure that comes with the hosting for the website aswel it must do. It doesn’t cost that to have a domain in an account I’ve got about 30 domain law it doesn’t  cost me anything apart from the yearly fee.  Let me look it up and il tell you what you need to do

[29/05/2022, 11:45:24] Elliot: I’ve been to busy winding up the Egg cunts to be honest… when we put the pic up of me Lucy, Ricardo and Andrew Laurence went fucking mad, then when that cunt Nikki got caught with all them fucking drugs, he went even more crazy and sent out vile messages to Lucy… I was ready to go punch him… so I missed all this about James
[29/05/2022, 11:46:48] .: It wasn’t much but after that night I he got it in his head again that it was me. I just had said I was reporting you so he would lol 2 + 2 but I’ve heard it from 2 people now

[29/05/2022, 11:48:21] Elliot: Well, I’ll go for him if I need to… just say the word 😉
[29/05/2022, 11:48:41] .: I’ve always let it ride no more. I’ve had a lot of opportunities ruined because of cunts like him while they are having it all nice nice

[29/05/2022, 11:51:15] .: I don’t care I don’t want to know what people are claiming, earning upto, not upto, involved in or not. Because I’ve learnt most are always upto something fucking dodgy and ruins innocent people when it goes wrong
[29/05/2022, 11:54:31] Elliot: This is true, but if they are out there trying to ruin your name… it needs revenge…
[29/05/2022, 11:55:03] Elliot: My old boss tried ruining my name I went fucking made and threatened him… he soon stopped
[29/05/2022, 11:56:19] Elliot: The biggest and most important thing to me is my reputation…. Anyone goes for it I won’t stop until it’s put right… this is one of the reasons why I won’t go back to eagle
[29/05/2022, 11:57:12] Elliot: Still think a bottle of piss and a box of stink bombs is a good idea though he he
[29/05/2022, 12:13:53] .: Lol well I don’t think anyone is going on about that night so you haven’t got anything to worry about lol

[30/05/2022, 13:14:52] .: Yeah exactly
[30/05/2022, 13:15:36] .: So they keep the booking free and pay out of that there booking free must be fucking massive to get 20k
[30/05/2022, 13:16:17] .: But my point you charge the ticket and booking fee and keep 100% lol
[30/05/2022, 13:38:21] Elliot: I like this…
[30/05/2022, 13:38:37] Elliot: They gave House of Trash £17k
[30/05/2022, 13:45:42] .: Yeah say you wanted £20 a ticket dice will charge a booking fee on top. Say £1.50 It cost about 46p processing fee so you make £1 per ticket. BAM it also cost fuck all to run either lol

[13/06/2022, 08:54:24] Elliot: BAM
[13/06/2022, 08:56:01] .: I don’t understand how these people have these nightclubs why the fuck would you do that when you can do it your self with a small cost lol
[13/06/2022, 08:56:06] .: Fucking stupid
[13/06/2022, 08:58:13] .: If I was to ever need a ticket to go to the egg or anywhere the  first place I would go would be their website not dice or whereever it is
[13/06/2022, 09:02:32] .: Sounds like bullshit a bit as well though , who told you that
[13/06/2022, 09:07:21] Elliot: Curtis, he has an inside man
[13/06/2022, 09:07:27] Elliot: Tell him everything
[13/06/2022, 09:08:13] .: Mmmm they minght be telling him shit as well know he’s friend with you
[13/06/2022, 09:09:16] Elliot: The inside joke is if they don’t like they will go to Electrokerkz lol
[13/06/2022, 09:09:53] Elliot: Not with me, with Curtis, they are after him to, to put House of Trash on at Egg
[13/06/2022, 09:10:32] .: So they desperate for gigs and a company has paid them 100k ? Lol
[13/06/2022, 09:11:10] Elliot: They are always desperate… £100k to lock them in for a 2 year deal
[13/06/2022, 09:11:26] Elliot: Curtis got £17k to lock HoT in with Dice
[13/06/2022, 09:12:01] .: Would you go pay a Dj 100k for the next 2 years ?? Not knowing what would happen
[13/06/2022, 09:12:09] .: 17 k how long for
[13/06/2022, 09:12:39] Elliot: 2 years
[13/06/2022, 09:12:53] Elliot: But they have targets to beat etc
[13/06/2022, 09:13:15] .: And Curtis is going monthly with HOT then?
[13/06/2022, 09:13:26] Elliot: Guess this is why they wanted Hans house
[13/06/2022, 09:13:50] Elliot: Trying to get him to do more got a contract meeting with him on Wednesday
[13/06/2022, 09:13:53] .: With that or dice must banging so heavy ticket fees on
[13/06/2022, 09:14:12] Elliot: 10% I think
[13/06/2022, 09:16:48] .: Hmmmm this dice willl be going out of business doing things like that lol
[13/06/2022, 09:18:00] Elliot: They are useless cunts… our contract runs out in October, can’t wait to drop em
[13/06/2022, 09:18:14] Elliot: The account manager is useless cunt
[13/06/2022, 09:23:00] .: Parties like HOT don’t need to use sites like dice. They are literally throwing extra revenue away. Of top of my head Curtis could be making an extra £1100 per event minimum by not using them
[13/06/2022, 09:25:04] .: How much were the house of trash tickets?
[13/06/2022, 09:31:42] Elliot: I’ll look hold on
[13/06/2022, 09:32:57] Elliot: They at £27.03 now
[13/06/2022, 09:35:13] Elliot: Oh it’s a waiting list
[13/06/2022, 09:35:30] .: Exactly that’s my point
‎[13/06/2022, 09:35:42] Elliot: ‎<attached: 00005826-PHOTO-2022-06-13-09-35-42.jpg>
[13/06/2022, 09:36:06] .: Curtis via instagram and word of mouth has sent people to that website to give them money when he could do it him self lol
[13/06/2022, 09:36:21] Elliot: Yeah I guess
[13/06/2022, 09:37:41] .: I’m not going to ask but depending on what Curtis has asked for per ticket they are literally making the remainder profits
[13/06/2022, 09:39:34] Elliot: Yeah I guess, I don’t fully understand the ticket side of things… would be better just to pay on the door like XXL did dirty cash he he
[13/06/2022, 09:40:34] .: I had to make a event management app as part of a tutorial I did with the cloud course I seen then the money they make for literally sending a email. Haha
[13/06/2022, 09:48:40] .: Well not much to understand othet than if the tickets are going for £27 and say Curtis is getting £20 Curtis is giving nearly £7700 away per event, obviously  it’s not that much that £27 is because it’s waiting list, but even if the tickets at normal price dice add money on what could be going in Curtis or better still YOUR pockets
[13/06/2022, 09:49:55] Elliot: Mmmmm ok I understand now
[13/06/2022, 14:53:20] .: How’s being dead
[13/06/2022, 14:53:45] Elliot: Terrible
[14/06/2022, 22:15:13] .: You in a coffin yet

‎[20/07/2022, 19:47:11] Elliot: ‎<attached: 00006396-PHOTO-2022-07-20-19-47-11.jpg>
[20/07/2022, 19:48:26] Elliot: Why would he dislike you ? Helping you when you needed it etc… he’s always loved you especially when you stop him from getting mugged in Vauxhall. 
You really are reading the wrong book babes
[20/07/2022, 19:52:21] .: I’ve had BPD since a being a teenager I don’t have friends if I don’t feel comfortable around. I was before and for some reason I don’t feel it around any of you now. So no I’m not reading the wrong book. I get the sense you seem to think I developed BPD during the pandemic? Wrong, that condition is no different now than it was before I just had a major depression on top of me to deal with and I’ve come out of it and there is a atmosphere. Not helped but other factors like dropping me 4 days after my mum died for a day trip to Fucking Oxford i thought wow what a good one that was then got worse invite me to Jessica James 1905th career launch as a consultation prize haha
[20/07/2022, 19:52:40] .: Don’t fucking tell me I’m reading it wrong!
[20/07/2022, 19:53:54] .: Then not telling me about covid
[20/07/2022, 19:53:59] .: At your bday

[20/07/2022, 19:54:30] .: Get fucked with your excuse on that
[20/07/2022, 19:56:05] Elliot: Omg ! 🙄 I give up
[20/07/2022, 19:57:30] .: I came out for that my bday all be it I came home I came out nye l…… I’ve told you countless times I’m worried about thinking I’ve done something to people for them to just cut me off you then don’t invite me out for pride and then let slip you’ve been telling people I stay in
[20/07/2022, 19:59:21] .: It’s like your wanting to fall out , you can’t do it the usuall way so we’ll do it this way ……make him think we still friends then do shit like you’ve done tell people he’s just stopped coming out and think il walk away quietly
[20/07/2022, 19:59:25] Elliot: I invite you everywhere, you decline, I keep inviting you, you keep declining… I ask you to come to the club, you decline… do you go out with other friends then ? Or stay home ?
[20/07/2022, 20:00:04] Elliot: I’m not the one trying to fall out with our friendship
[20/07/2022, 20:02:00] .: You invite me to places I don’t feel comfortable like Curtis party I’ve did I feel like somethings has gone on there. Never had a invite and had stopped talking why would I go there? Roast I design a website for it encouraged by you to be then just told not really my decisions.  You would have know that when I said I was doing it
[20/07/2022, 20:03:09] Elliot: No I said do it then come in and show us like I’ve told you with everything
[20/07/2022, 20:03:25] .: Neither am I have like I said I came out your bday my bday nye the first trough
[20/07/2022, 20:03:52] .: Then see sarcasm about keeping you company from Andrew
[20/07/2022, 20:04:30] .: I asked to go Vauxhall you went with out me
[20/07/2022, 20:05:55] .: I’ve literally been biting my tounge for months on it I’ve showed other people thinking its on my head but there too many things happened for me not to think this way
[20/07/2022, 20:06:14] Elliot: Well, if you came out we could go out.. and before going out sit down and talk…
[20/07/2022, 20:07:07] .: You know full well how many times I’ve said if it’s me being upset what’s caused this atmosphere and people to cut me off
[20/07/2022, 20:07:23] Elliot: All we been doing is working day and night at the club, happy for you to come on board and join us but you keep saying no
[20/07/2022, 20:08:14] Elliot: We gave you space to Greave, dunno, did you want us to come and mollycoddle you all the time ?
[20/07/2022, 20:08:17] .: And when would be a goo opportunity to go out oooo like pride and the day I came up and said let’s go out and one other Occasion after that
[20/07/2022, 20:08:32] .: When you went with out me

[20/07/2022, 20:09:54] Elliot: Soho is Vile when sober
[20/07/2022, 20:10:02] Elliot: And 3 hours sleep
[20/07/2022, 20:10:10] .: I tried to cancel that thinking that was causing this atmosphere and people to just go cold on me. I tried to block her out made it ten times Fucking worse
[20/07/2022, 20:10:11] Elliot: With a 8 hour shift to come
[20/07/2022, 20:10:24] .: Hmmm I bet
