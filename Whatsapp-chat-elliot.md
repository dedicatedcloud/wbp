22/12/2020, 16:53 - Shane: Putting the sarcasm aside I actually have been. 



Trying to defend my mum to a pharmacist and I can't get my head around why he won't take onboard what I'm saying, its unreal

22/12/2020, 16:54 - Elliot: Can you not go to a different one ?

22/12/2020, 16:55 - Elliot: Are you registered as her career

22/12/2020, 16:55 - Shane: No listen....

22/12/2020, 17:14 - Shane: It's a long on but go with me on this because I think im going crazy lol



She goes for dialysis Tue Thursday, Saturday, they deliver, Mon Tue Wed. 



She's been taken in for a blood transfusion at the last minute on 3 occasions and its fell on a delivery day, however she got the neighbor to watch for him and get it so the service has been provided and she got the meds albeit at her neighbor's. 



Because she's missed 

him he's took her of the delivery list and won't put her back on. I went to see him as well as pick up a script. I said can I speak to Austin, hes one of the nicest people I've ever met,well I thought so but, he just shoved the tablets in my hand and it turned into him more or less  screaming at me in front of a carpark full of people, her illness and medical history been shouted all over the place and said it's no excuse for missing the delivery. I said so she needs to be at her door at the same time as piped up to a dialysis machine 12  miles away,  YES She does. Where can I go from that lol

22/12/2020, 18:10 - Elliot: Sorry was doing the dinner

22/12/2020, 18:10 - Elliot: I‚Äôd report him

22/12/2020, 18:10 - Elliot: Cunt

22/12/2020, 18:11 - Elliot: As long as the pills etc is being collected then there is no reason why he should have taken her off the delivery service... tell the Hospital to, maybe they can sort it... he‚Äôs playing with her life, making me angry now...

22/12/2020, 18:19 - Shane: This is my issue why has she got to be there. I went it to shock but I can remember him saying housebound when going off. 



She not house bound. She was offered it when a staff member seen how much she was struggling to walk. She said her bones are killing her (which now we know why, bone cancer I think anyway), .......Carole I've put you on the delivery lost from now on....

22/12/2020, 18:19 - Shane: Then she off it for some reason

22/12/2020, 18:19 - Shane: Fuck knows

22/12/2020, 18:19 - Shane: Lo

22/12/2020, 18:20 - Elliot: Is he the owner ?

22/12/2020, 18:20 - Shane: I've looked him up a director of the company.

22/12/2020, 18:20 - Shane: I'm shocked he went off like that.

22/12/2020, 18:21 - Elliot: You need to tell the hospital so they can send the prescription‚Äôs somewhere else or do it themselves

22/12/2020, 18:21 - Elliot: Tell you GP

22/12/2020, 18:21 - Elliot: I‚Äôd have gone Fucking mad at him

22/12/2020, 18:21 - Elliot: so what are you going to do ?

22/12/2020, 18:22 - Shane: I literally went down there last night to ask two questions. What is your delivery policy does my mum need to be in for the prescription and if so under the circumstances I've just explained when she's gone for a blood transfusion could those policies be bent and be delivered to the neighbor's. If was a no fine il do it online. Didnt even get a chance. Haha

22/12/2020, 18:24 - Shane: I've set it all up today boots. Its bugging me. 25 years she's been going there and when I said il just get it online he was literally jumping up and down and couldn't seem to tide of her quick enough.

22/12/2020, 18:25 - Elliot: Slag him off on google review and report him to the pharmacy Society or whatever it‚Äôs called

22/12/2020, 18:25 - Elliot: Good glad you sorted it... he‚Äôs sounds a right cunt

22/12/2020, 18:26 - Shane: Usually I'd just ignore it, but it's not helping the fact I'm trying not to think about the fact my nephew has tested positive for covid and was here jumping about all over Last week

22/12/2020, 18:26 - Shane: I maybe overthinking shit I dunno

22/12/2020, 18:27 - Elliot: Oh god, get a Covid test, you should be able to get one with your mums status

07/09/2021, 15:26 - Shane: Glad it didnt come while I was asleep

07/09/2021, 20:55 - Elliot: A duck walks into a pub and orders a pint of beer and a ham sandwich.



The barman looks at him and says,



"Hang on! You're a duck."



"I see your eyes are working," replies the duck.



"And you can talk!" Exclaims the barman.



"I see your ears are working, too," says the duck.



"Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?"



"Certainly, sorry about that,"



Says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.



"It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing around this way?"



"I'm working on the building site across the road," Explains the duck.



"I'm a plasterer."



The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.



So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.



The same thing happens for two weeks.



Then one day the circus comes to town.



The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him



"You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!"



"Sounds marvellous," says the ringmaster, handing over his business card.



"Get him to give me a call."



So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says,



"Hey Mr Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money."



"I'm always looking for the next job,"



Says the duck.



"Where is it?"



"At the circus,"



Says the barman.



"The circus?"



Repeats the duck.



"That's right,"



Replies the barman.



"The circus?"



The duck asks again.



‚ÄúWith the big tent?"



"Yeah," the barman replies.



"With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?" says the duck.



"Of course," the barman replies.



"And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?" persists the duck.



"That's right!" says the barman.



The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says .. . ...... 



"What the fuck would they want with a plasterer??!"üòÇ

23/09/2021, 13:54 - Shane: Sorry been asleep for 2 days on tablets. 



Well it's been mixed messages from that hospital 3 times they have said she's dying and 24 hours is critical. They let my sister go at midnight last night mum knew who she was and was alert. An older doctor says he is shocked she has lasted this long with her other illness so hes going to give and go as much as he can with her. Most cant believe she lasted the weekend I know i cant so it's just a waiting game.

23/09/2021, 13:57 - Elliot: Oh dear, so sad, she‚Äôs a fighter‚Ä¶ although the hospital were the same with my mum, said they think she won‚Äôt make it, 3 years later it‚Äôs like nothing ever happened

23/09/2021, 14:01 - Shane: Think half of them at the hospital just want an easy life and would let people like elderly and ill just die off

23/09/2021, 14:02 - Elliot: Yeah think your right‚Ä¶. Unless you have a go at them they will

23/09/2021, 14:03 - Shane: Well I said il take legal action if you stop treatment on Saturday when I spoke to them seems to have all changed then

28/09/2021, 20:21 - Elliot: Ha ha, good for her, but you messed her about something rotten

28/09/2021, 20:22 - Shane: I said mum didn't want him there it's on you üò≥ but she needs the support and shes got to see him and he had her kids. I wanted to say well if he was a good person he would know it's me and not have any issue with her......but that's the cunt he is he would punish her for it and she knows it hes evil

28/09/2021, 20:23 - Shane: He will take his new GF as well

28/09/2021, 20:23 - Elliot: Yeah, it‚Äôs a bit out of order, he left her, so why go to her funeral‚Ä¶

28/09/2021, 20:24 - Elliot: Upsetting for you.. maybe he wants to make up to you ?

28/09/2021, 20:24 - Shane: This is sums him up....when we was young and been little shits she rang him for help, his response was put them in care, she didn't and now she's dead.  And people think sun shines out of his arsehole

28/09/2021, 20:25 - Shane: And I was a fcuker I admit

28/09/2021, 20:25 - Shane: But least I let her wishes be known il sleep easy

28/09/2021, 20:25 - Elliot: Maybe bring it up at the wake and really show them what a cunt he was

28/09/2021, 20:25 - Elliot: Threaten that

28/09/2021, 20:25 - Shane: I'm not going

28/09/2021, 20:26 - Elliot: Omg why ?

28/09/2021, 20:27 - Shane: Because I cant bare any of them....I spoke to my auntie and told her what mum said well I found that hard to believe they were so friendly on keris wedding in Cyprus, I'm thinking cant you fucking see my mum was chatty and nice because of keri not because she liked him

28/09/2021, 20:28 - Shane: I just cant be around all that

28/09/2021, 20:29 - Shane: I knew he would be going what mum said or i want is irrelevant

28/09/2021, 20:29 - Elliot: Ok, well you have your reasons but I just hope you don‚Äôt regret it, I guess you can always go up and visit her grave at a later date

28/09/2021, 20:29 - Elliot: When is it ?

[16/05/2022, 13:28:38] Elliot: He counts it babes

[16/05/2022, 13:28:41] Elliot: I order

[16/05/2022, 13:31:00] Shane: I‚Äôd have had it all automated by now lol

[16/05/2022, 13:32:53] Elliot: Errr it‚Äôs different each week babes

[16/05/2022, 13:33:33] Shane: Yeah bur that doesn‚Äôt change the system what I‚Äôd be using

[16/05/2022, 13:33:42] Elliot: Ooooo ok

[16/05/2022, 13:33:53] Shane: Count put it in a app and bam ordered sent

[16/05/2022, 13:42:55] Elliot: Yeah‚Ä¶ üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

[16/05/2022, 13:43:22] Shane: I can build it you if you want

[16/05/2022, 13:54:40] Elliot: How much will that cost ?

[16/05/2022, 14:38:10] Shane: Free derrr

[16/05/2022, 14:40:27] Elliot: Ok come in and show me how it works babes üëçüèªüëçüèª

[16/05/2022, 14:40:32] Elliot: I like the free bit

[16/05/2022, 14:42:06] Shane: Do you get sales figures of what you have sold each night per product

[16/05/2022, 14:42:24] Elliot: Yes babes

[16/05/2022, 14:42:59] Shane: So you know what stick you have you just count it to make sure it‚Äôs all there?

[16/05/2022, 14:43:06] Shane: Stock

[16/05/2022, 14:50:28] Elliot: Count it then I check it against the figures to see if anyone has nicked it

[16/05/2022, 16:23:44] Shane: Kinda defeats the point really. You‚Äôd have to tally it all up to get a figure with the app as it‚Äôs not connected to the tills.

[16/05/2022, 16:28:26] Shane: What pos do you use Sqaure ?



I suppose it could be used for like the spirit cellar every time they take a bottle out they have to scan it help you keep track of high value Stuff

[16/05/2022, 16:30:49] Elliot: Yeah‚Ä¶ the reason we are doing it like this, as with everything in this place the tills are fucked as they haven‚Äôt been set up and used properly from the start so instead of having all the stock figures correctly in the till system they are running at 10000000s üôÑ 

That, plus we are looking at changing the till system

[16/05/2022, 16:34:51] Shane: Silly fucks

[16/05/2022, 16:36:01] Elliot: Yep, It is like this with everything we have come across

[18/05/2022, 12:04:04] Elliot: Hi ya

[18/05/2022, 12:04:06] Elliot: So

[18/05/2022, 12:04:26] Elliot: Tell me‚Ä¶. 

Why is this costing him this much ??

‚Äé[18/05/2022, 12:04:29] Elliot: ![image](static/WA-elliot/00004362-PHOTO-2022-05-18-12-04-29.jpg)

[18/05/2022, 12:07:08] Shane: It must be attached to a hosting package with that company. Is that what the main website is on .co.uk ?

[18/05/2022, 12:07:55] Elliot: Yes

[18/05/2022, 12:08:12] Elliot: So we shouldn‚Äôt be paying ¬£28 a month then ?

[18/05/2022, 12:12:08] Shane: No well that depends to have a domain like . Co .uK.  Doesn‚Äôt cost anything apart from a yearly fee which is like ¬£6 ish but you need to find out if that fee included the web hosting which is with Google I think it must be. You need to plan before you move it as well. It‚Äôs free to transfer a uk domain but you need to make sure the DNS is set up to avoid down time.

[18/05/2022, 12:12:57] Elliot: Errr ok ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[18/05/2022, 12:13:13] Shane: Let me look a few things up

[18/05/2022, 12:14:04] Elliot: Just want to know why he saying it‚Äôs ¬£28 a month

[18/05/2022, 12:15:51] Shane: I‚Äôm sure that comes with the hosting for the website aswel it must do. It doesn‚Äôt cost that to have a domain in an account I‚Äôve got about 30 domain law it doesn‚Äôt  cost me anything apart from the yearly fee.  Let me look it up and il tell you what you need to do

[18/05/2022, 12:16:02] Shane: Who runs the website?

[18/05/2022, 12:21:59] Elliot: We do now

[18/05/2022, 12:22:33] Shane: Ok so what web host do you use?

[18/05/2022, 12:22:55] Elliot: Haven‚Äôt a clue

[18/05/2022, 12:23:32] Shane: Well I know but it weebly it‚Äôs like any company can sell lol

[18/05/2022, 12:26:51] Elliot: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I haven‚Äôt a clue what you just said

[18/05/2022, 12:30:42] Shane: Hah it‚Äôs hard to explain the website is built with a shitty website builder called weebly and loads of hosting company‚Äôs sell it as an add on when people buy a domain or hosting package. Message him and ask him if it 28 includes the web hosting for the website as well. ?

[18/05/2022, 12:39:25] Shane: Jesus I‚Äôve just transferred one of my domains to them to see how there system works fucking hell! Don‚Äôt transfer anything yet because it will all go down including the gmail

[18/05/2022, 12:40:27] Elliot: Think Andrew and Ricardo know what to do, Andrew just tried to explain it to me ha ha

[18/05/2022, 12:42:21] Shane: Lol make sure you have secondary dns to be on the safe side of you move it

[18/05/2022, 12:44:05] Elliot: I‚Äôm not fucking touching it lol

[18/05/2022, 12:45:09] Shane: Thing is tho you may if it‚Äôs transferred to you and the dns records don‚Äôt

[18/05/2022, 12:45:14] Elliot: I‚Äôm having nightmares with the fucking printer so I‚Äôm not touching anything internet ha ha ha

[20/05/2022, 15:43:20] Shane: You still got a website up lol?

[13/06/2022, 08:54:24] Elliot: BAM

[13/06/2022, 08:56:01] Shane: I don‚Äôt understand how these people have these nightclubs why the fuck would you do that when you can do it your self with a small cost lol

[13/06/2022, 08:56:06] Shane: Fucking stupid

[13/06/2022, 08:58:13] Shane: If I was to ever need a ticket to go to the egg or anywhere the  first place I would go would be their website not dice or whereever it is

[13/06/2022, 09:02:32] Shane: Sounds like bullshit a bit as well though , who told you that

[13/06/2022, 09:07:21] Elliot: Curtis, he has an inside man

[13/06/2022, 09:07:27] Elliot: Tell him everything

[13/06/2022, 09:08:13] Shane: Mmmm they minght be telling him shit as well know he‚Äôs friend with you

[13/06/2022, 09:09:16] Elliot: The inside joke is if they don‚Äôt like they will go to Electrokerkz lol

[13/06/2022, 09:09:53] Elliot: Not with me, with Curtis, they are after him to, to put House of Trash on at Egg

[13/06/2022, 09:10:32] Shane: So they desperate for gigs and a company has paid them 100k ? Lol

[13/06/2022, 09:11:10] Elliot: They are always desperate‚Ä¶ ¬£100k to lock them in for a 2 year deal

[13/06/2022, 09:11:26] Elliot: Curtis got ¬£17k to lock HoT in with Dice

[13/06/2022, 09:12:01] Shane: Would you go pay a Dj 100k for the next 2 years ?? Not knowing what would happen

[13/06/2022, 09:12:09] Shane: 17 k how long for

[13/06/2022, 09:12:39] Elliot: 2 years

[13/06/2022, 09:12:53] Elliot: But they have targets to beat etc

[13/06/2022, 09:13:15] Shane: And Curtis is going monthly with HOT then?

[13/06/2022, 09:13:26] Elliot: Guess this is why they wanted Hans house

[13/06/2022, 09:13:50] Elliot: Trying to get him to do more got a contract meeting with him on Wednesday

[13/06/2022, 09:13:53] Shane: With that or dice must banging so heavy ticket fees on

[13/06/2022, 09:14:12] Elliot: 10% I think

[13/06/2022, 09:16:48] Shane: Hmmmm this dice willl be going out of business doing things like that lol

[13/06/2022, 09:18:00] Elliot: They are useless cunts‚Ä¶ our contract runs out in October, can‚Äôt wait to drop em

[13/06/2022, 09:18:14] Elliot: The account manager is useless cunt

[13/06/2022, 09:23:00] Shane: Parties like HOT don‚Äôt need to use sites like dice. They are literally throwing extra revenue away. Of top of my head Curtis could be making an extra ¬£1100 per event minimum by not using them

[13/06/2022, 09:25:04] Shane: How much were the house of trash tickets?

[13/06/2022, 09:31:42] Elliot: I‚Äôll look hold on

[13/06/2022, 09:32:57] Elliot: They at ¬£27.03 now

[13/06/2022, 09:35:13] Elliot: Oh it‚Äôs a waiting list

[13/06/2022, 09:35:30] Shane: Exactly that‚Äôs my point

‚Äé[13/06/2022, 09:35:42] Elliot: ![image](static/WA-elliot/00005826-PHOTO-2022-06-13-09-35-42.jpg)

[13/06/2022, 09:36:06] Shane: Curtis via instagram and word of mouth has sent people to that website to give them money when he could do it him self lol

[13/06/2022, 09:36:21] Elliot: Yeah I guess

[13/06/2022, 09:37:41] Shane: I‚Äôm not going to ask but depending on what Curtis has asked for per ticket they are literally making the remainder profits

[13/06/2022, 09:39:34] Elliot: Yeah I guess, I don‚Äôt fully understand the ticket side of things‚Ä¶ would be better just to pay on the door like XXL did dirty cash he he

[13/06/2022, 09:40:34] Shane: I had to make a event management app as part of a tutorial I did with the cloud course I seen then the money they make for literally sending a email. Haha

[13/06/2022, 09:48:40] Shane: Well not much to understand othet than if the tickets are going for ¬£27 and say Curtis is getting ¬£20 Curtis is giving nearly ¬£7700 away per event, obviously  it‚Äôs not that much that ¬£27 is because it‚Äôs waiting list, but even if the tickets at normal price dice add money on what could be going in Curtis or better still YOUR pockets

[13/06/2022, 09:49:55] Elliot: Mmmmm ok I understand now

[13/06/2022, 14:53:20] Shane: How‚Äôs being dead

[13/06/2022, 14:53:45] Elliot: Terrible

[20/07/2022, 19:52:21] Shane: I‚Äôve had BPD since a being a teenager I don‚Äôt have friends if I don‚Äôt feel comfortable around. I was before and for some reason I don‚Äôt feel it around any of you now. So no I‚Äôm not reading the wrong book. I get the sense you seem to think I developed BPD during the pandemic? Wrong, that condition is no different now than it was before I just had a major depression on top of me to deal with and I‚Äôve come out of it and there is a atmosphere. Not helped but other factors like dropping me 4 days after my mum died for a day trip to Fucking Oxford i thought wow what a good one that was then got worse invite me to Jessica James 1905th career launch as a consultation prize haha

[20/07/2022, 19:52:40] Shane: Don‚Äôt fucking tell me I‚Äôm reading it wrong!
